Hi there! 

Final project: NBA MVP full-stack web application for CPSC2100 MERN Stack course.

1. run npm install

On the right, we have a list of the NBA teams. On click, we have the players pop up in the format of last name first, and then first name. On the top of the web application, you can see the search bars for a player search! Insert the player's first and last name to see that player's headshot. As someone who loves playing with CSS, you may notice some cool onhover attributes here and there. 

Just a note, the NBA data is from the 2018-2019 season, so a little bit outdated, yet still fully functioning. Special thanks to <a href="https://balldontlie.io"> balldontlie api </a> and <a href="https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/"> nba-players heroku app </a> for stacking me up with super cool APIs to use.

Web application created using React.js, node.js, webpack, ES6, and axios.
